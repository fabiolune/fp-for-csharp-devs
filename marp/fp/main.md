# Introduction to Functional Programming

Functional programming is an approach to software development based, as the name suggests, on functions.

---

# Understanding Functions

Functions should be seen as **mathematical functions**.

---

# Mathematical Function Definition

Mathematical functions have a precise definition:
- Subsets of the Cartesian product of two sets.
- Elements of the first set appear only once.

---

# Practical Definition of Functions

A function from a set A to a set B can be defined as:
- A specific rule to transform each element of the first set into an element of the second.
