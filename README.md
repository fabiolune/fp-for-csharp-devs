# Functional programming for C# developers

This repo contains the source code for a presentation on Functional programming in _dotnet_.
The slides are prepared using [marp](https://marp.app/).

## Generate the slides


To generate a pdf version of the slides:
```shell
./scripts/build-marp.sh src pdf

Similarly, you can create an html version of them by just running:
```shell
./scripts/build-marp.sh src html
```
